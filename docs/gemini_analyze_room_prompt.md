# Prompt: Detailní analýza fotografie místnosti

```
Analyze this photograph in extreme detail. I need a precise description for image editing purposes.

Describe:

1. CAMERA
   - Exact viewing angle (eye level, low, high?)
   - Camera position in the room (which corner? how far from walls?)
   - Lens distortion (wide angle? fisheye? standard?)
   - Orientation (landscape/portrait)

2. ARCHITECTURE - describe position of each element as LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT and FOREGROUND/MIDDLE/BACKGROUND
   - All walls visible (how many? angles between them?)
   - Windows (count, position, size, frame color, what's visible through them?)
   - Doors/openings (position, size, where do they lead?)
   - Corners (where exactly in the frame?)
   - Ceiling (visible? any fixtures?)
   - Floor (material, color, condition)

3. LIGHTING
   - Light sources (windows? which ones are brightest?)
   - Shadow direction and length
   - Shadow shapes on floor (describe precisely)
   - Overall brightness distribution

4. SURFACES
   - Wall texture and color
   - Floor texture and color
   - Any marks, stains, construction elements visible

5. OBJECTS
   - Anything already in the room (cables, fixtures, marks on walls)
   - Watermarks or overlays on the photo

6. MEASUREMENTS (estimate)
   - Room dimensions based on window sizes (standard windows ~120cm wide)
   - Ceiling height
   - Distance from camera to back wall

Output as structured text I can use as reference for image editing.
