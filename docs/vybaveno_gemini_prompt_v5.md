# Gemini Banana Pro — Virtual Staging Prompt v5

## TASK: Edit this exact photograph by adding furniture

You previously analyzed this room. Now edit the SAME image — add furniture while preserving all architecture exactly as you described it.

---

## PRESERVE EXACTLY (from your analysis):

**Camera:** Eye level, front-left corner, wide-angle lens, landscape orientation

**Architecture:**
- Left wall with door opening (80-90cm) leading to dark hallway
- Back wall with double-casement window (white frame, ~150cm wide)
- Right wall with protruding structural column/pillar creating a niche
- Partially visible large windows on far right (causing sunlight)
- Corner where left wall meets back wall (visible floor to ceiling)

**Lighting:**
- Strong direct sunlight from right side windows
- Shadows going RIGHT → LEFT
- Hard-edged geometric shadow pattern on left wall and floor
- Diffuse light from back window

**Surfaces:**
- Raw gypsum plaster walls (blotchy white/light grey, unfinished)
- Raw cement/screed floor (matte, dusty, grainy grey)
- Electrical socket holes on all walls
- Wire/hook on ceiling center
- Loose wire at back window

**Keep:** Bazos.cz watermark in bottom right

## ADD THIS FURNITURE:

1. **Dark blue L-shaped sofa** (290×95cm)
   - Position: Against BACK WALL, under the window
   - L-section extends toward camera

2. **Dark oak coffee table** (120×60cm)
   - Position: CENTER of room, in front of sofa
   - On the cement floor (no rug yet)

3. **Brown leather armchair** (79×79cm)  
   - Position: RIGHT side, near the structural column
   - Angled 45° facing toward sofa/table

4. **Dark oak cabinet** (80×40×126cm)
   - Position: LEFT WALL, between door opening and left edge of frame

5. **Large rug** (240×350cm, white/brown/blue pattern)
   - Position: On floor, under coffee table, defining seating area

6. **White sheer curtains** 
   - Position: On BACK window and RIGHT windows (the ones causing sunlight)

---

## LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS:

- Furniture shadows must go RIGHT → LEFT (matching existing sun shadows)
- Furniture on left side (cabinet) should be lit by the sun patch
- Furniture in center/back should have softer lighting
- Maintain the high contrast (bright sun vs dark hallway)

---

## OUTPUT:

Photorealistic result. The room should still look like an unfinished construction site with raw plaster and cement — just with furniture staged in it.
